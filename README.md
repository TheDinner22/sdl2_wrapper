# SDL2 wrapper

classes and functions to make working with
SDL2 (written in C) easier when using SDL2 in C++.

## i am sorry

this code is dog shit i have decided

## tutorial

I learned most of what I know about SDL2 from:
https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php#Geometry%20Rendering

lots of the code may look like it was stolen from there (it was)

## running this code

good luck bro!
makefile works for me and (for now) thats all that matters

### ubuntu

if you are on ubuntu then try:
- sudo apt install libsdl2-dev -y
- sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev -y

and then calling `make` might get you a working binary
